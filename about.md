# About
I'm just a weeb who has (some) free-time. Learning both programming and Japanese, though doing horribly at both.

At the moment I've done work with two active game projects, both on Roblox, one of them being a personal project.

My personal project is [Tennis Showdown][showdown]. All programming work and most of the animations were done by me, with a good friend helping me out with his building skills. A project that I'm personally proud of and have had fun both working on and playing with.

The other project which I help out with is [Volleyball 4.2][volleyball], a much more popular sports game. I mainly contribute accessibility for mobile players but also help out occasionally with other parts of the project.
