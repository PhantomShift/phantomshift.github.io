Recently at the CD shop I visit sometimes
I met someone I'm interested in.
They ususally stand by the counter listlessly
covered in all black.
They look so cool today too...

Their fashion...
Their mystique...
Even their taste in music is perfect!
(Aside) I love Nirvana too!
I might start fangirling...
Well, I'm happy even if it's just watching from afar
Ow!
Augh!
It's caught in my hair...
