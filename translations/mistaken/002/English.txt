You mean the guy at the shop?
You'll defo forget that guy's face (lol)

You've gotten to see them a lot since you meet them every day...
After all, your crush is the girl sitting right next to you.
I should hurry and clear up this misunderstanding
However,
If I were to suddenly bring it up in class...
(Aside) Uh? Like, sorry,
(Aside) Who are you? (lol)
*Caption Prejudice of the high class
... No good,
I'll just explain it next time I meet her here.
(Aside) Yeah, that should be fine
